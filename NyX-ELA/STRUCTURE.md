# NyX-ELA Project Structure

This scaffold initializes the requested NyX-ELA repository layout with top-level project files, docs, source package skeletons, testing folders, scripts, examples, plugins, web assets, and GitHub workflow/template directories.

It also creates symlinks at project root:
- `wordlists -> src/nyx_ela/data/wordlists`
- `payloads -> src/nyx_ela/data/payloads`
- `exploits -> src/nyx_ela/data/exploits`
